Simple scripts for use with the limitations of BusyBox on GL.iNet GL-MT6000 'Flint 2' router. 

Found myself frustrated with errors generated by the lack of standard/expected options with 
BusyBox commands (like the missing -f for ping - Don't fragment). 

These scripts creatively work with/around BusyBox limitations by keeping things simple and 
using alternative methods to what would otherwise be available in a full *NIX environment. 

Likely NOT the most efficient methods and code. That's OK :-)
